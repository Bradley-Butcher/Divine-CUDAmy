# The Divine CUDAmy
## *An unnecessarily painful journey through machine learning*

Greetings, dear reader! If you've picked up this book, you're either incredibly brave or incredibly foolish. Or perhaps you're just incredibly bored. Either way, welcome to "The Divine CUDAmy: An unnecessarily painful journey through machine learning"! Even the title is painful. Alas, ChatGPT was having a bad day.

I will be your humble guide, an author who's just as lost as you are, fumbling through the dark corridors of CUDA and machine learning, armed with nothing but a dimly lit torch of knowledge and a rusty sword of Python code. Yes, you read that right. I'm learning as I go along, just like you. So, if you were expecting a seasoned expert, I'm afraid you're out of luck. But don't worry, we'll muddle through this together, stumbling over the same stones, tripping into the same pitfalls, and occasionally, just occasionally, experiencing those glorious "Eureka!" moments.

Now, you might be wondering, "Why on earth would I want to learn CUDA for machine learning?" Well, let me tell you, it's not for the faint of heart, especially for someone like me who hasn't touched anything but Python since he was forced to learn Java in university. However, I personally expect getting the know the hardware is going to become increasingly important in machine learning. As we approach the limits of Moore's Law, and NVIDIA's manufacturing speed, we'll need to squeeze every last drop of performance out of our hardware. 

In this book, we'll start with the basics, the simple stuff, the "Hello, World!" of CUDA and machine learning. Then, we'll slowly move into some advanced algorithms, perhaps reimplement parts of PyTorch, and finally, we'll end with a bang, a full-blown machine learning project. Along the way, we'll learn about CUDA, machine learning, and the mysterious world of GPU programming.

Now, I must warn you, dear reader, this journey is not for the easily disheartened. I will, from time to time, insult your intelligence, question your sanity, and generally make a nuisance of myself. But remember, it's all in good fun. After all, we're in this together, you and I. We're comrades-in-arms, battling against the forces of ignorance and confusion, striving to reach that elusive peak of knowledge.

So, buckle up, strap on your helmet, and prepare for the ride of your life. It's going to be a bumpy, bruising, and bewildering journey, but I promise you, it'll be worth it. And remember, no matter how tough it gets, no matter how many times you feel like throwing your computer out the window, don't give up. Just remember what it's all truly about: <strike>the joy of learning</strike> optimizing employability.

Welcome to the wild, wacky, and wonderfully weird world of CUDA for Machine Learning. Let the adventure begin!

Oh, and Iâ€™ve never read the divine comedy.
